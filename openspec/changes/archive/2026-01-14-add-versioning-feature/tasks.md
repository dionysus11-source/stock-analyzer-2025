## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1. Create a `_version.py` file to store the application version string.
- [x] 1.2. Modify `main.py` to read the version from `_version.py`.
- [x] 1.3. Update `ui_components.py` to include a UI element (e.g., a label in the status bar) that displays the version string.
- [x] 1.4. Update the main window creation in `main.py` to pass the version string to the UI components.

## 2. Testing
- [x] 2.1. Run the application and visually confirm that the correct version number is displayed in the main window.
- [x] 2.2. Update the version in `_version.py` and ensure the UI reflects the change upon restart.

## 3. Documentation
- [x] 3.1. Add a section to `README.md` explaining how to update the version number in `_version.py` when preparing a new release.
