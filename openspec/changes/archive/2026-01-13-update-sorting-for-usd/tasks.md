## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Locate the sorting function for the analysis results table in the `ui_components.py` file.
- [x] 1.2 Modify the sorting logic to correctly handle numeric values for both KRW and USD when sorting the 'Profit/Loss' column.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure the sorting toggles between ascending and descending order correctly.

## 2. Verification
- [x] 2.1 Manually test the sorting functionality with a dataset containing both KRW and USD entries.
- [x] 2.2 Confirm that clicking the 'Profit/Loss' header sorts both currencies correctly in ascending and descending order.
